---

## Prerequisites

- Tune your operating system for optimal performance by following the Swarm64 DA guidelines in
the Swarm64 DA documentation.
- Ensure that EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed and running.
- For CentOS 7, you need to install the following repository:

```bash
sudo yum install -y epel-release centos-release-scl
```

## Installation and Configuration of Swarm64 DA

The following steps outlined below are for CentOS. See the Swarm64 documentation for full details on
installation and configuration for CentoOS and other supported operating systems.

1. Install the Swarm64 DA repository:

```bash
curl -s
https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/swarm64/s
warm64da/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```

2. Install the corresponding `Swarm64 DA` package for your EDB Postgres Advanced Server
installation.

**EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12**

```bash
sudo yum install swarm64da-epas-12
```

3. Add `swarm64da` to `shared_preload_libraries` in your `postgresql.conf` configuration file. For example:

```bash
shared_preload_libraries = 'swarm64da'
```

For other recommended settings, see the section *Recommended EPAS settings* in the Swarm64
documentation.

4. Restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

5. Switch to a user with access to the database:

```bash
sudo su - enterprisedb
```

6. Connect to the database:

```bash
edb-psql -d postgres
```

7. Load the Swarm64 DA extension:

```bash
CREATE EXTENSION swarm64da;
```

A NOTICE is printed when executing the first SQL command through a connection to a database
for which the swarm64da extension has not been created yet. This behavior is controlled by the
following configuration parameter:

`swarm64da.enable_notice_not_created_extension(boolean)`

Enables or disables the reminder to create the extension. The default is `on`.

8. Verify that the Swarm64 DA extension is loaded correctly and look up its version number:

```bash
SELECT * FROM swarm64da.get_version();
```

9. Install a valid license.

```bash
SELECT swarm64da.load_license('<path-to-license-file-on-server>');
```

See also Install a license for Swarm64 DA in the Swarm64 DA documentation.

10. Check and follow the Swarm64 DA settings advisor and documented recommendations to tune your database system for optimal performance.

```bash
SELECT * FROM swarm64da.show_advice();
```

See also Settings advisor and Recommended EPAS settings in the Swarm64 DA documentation.

11. Create columnstore indexes.

Columnstore indexes are necessary to maximize the performance benefits. Create an index foreach large table covering the most common accessed columns. See Columnstore index and Using a columnstore index on a small TPC-H data set.

## Integration Views

The following is a sample EDB Postgres Advanced Server configuration optimized for use with Swarm64
DA. Note this configuration is typically stored in a file separate from postgresql.conf. A reference is
made in postgresql.conf to this location.

Create a directory within the PostgreSQL working directory:

```bash
[root@r640-2 pg12-host]# mkdir conf.d
```

Create a new file in the conf.d directory:

```bash
[root@r640-2 conf.d]# vim s64_settings.conf
```

Specify include_dir in postgresql.conf:
