## 3.1 Prerequisites

**1. The database host with the EDB Postgres Advanced environment needs the following components:**
    
• An IBM supported operating system for Spectrum Protect clients.

• The Spectrum Protect BA client (used for regular file backup).

• The Spectrum Protect API client.

• EDB Postgres Advanced version 9.6 or above.

• Repostor Data Protector client.


**2. A PostgreSQL user needs to be defined for use with the RDP.**
    

• This user needs to be able to connect to EDB Postgres Advanced and have sufficient permissions for
database backup & restore.

• This user needs access to local Spectrum Protect files. To read configuration files and to write to log files.


!!! Note
    If the user is not the same user that owns the PostgreSQL server process, one also needs to make sure that the server
    process owner has the correct SP client file access. This is due to the ‘archive_command’ being executed as that user.


**3. A Spectrum Protect ‘node’ needs to be defined in the Spectrum Protect server environment, in a
management class that suits the needs of the DBA team.**

**4. The Spectrum Protect client details for setting up connection to Spectrum Protect server needs to be
available, including the client Spectrum Protect password.**


## 3.2 Installation and configuration of Repostor Data Protector for PostgreSQL

**1. Configure local Spectrum Protect configuration files with Spectrum Protect details needed to connect to
Spectrum Protect server.**

a. Create Spectrum Protect options file with logical Servername.

b. Edit dsm.sys file. Add section for new logical Servername for this Spectrum Protect node, using
connection details.

c. Create soft links from API directory to ba clients bin directory, for dsm.sys and dsm.opt.

Sample using Spectrum Protect options filename dsm.postgres.opt:

 
    ln -s /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys
        /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/dsm.sys
    ln -s /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.postgres.opt
        /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/dsm.opt
    

Sample listing (ls -l command) from API directory, showing the links:

    
    dsm.opt -> /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.postgres.opt
    dsm.sys -> /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys
    

d. Set variable DSMI_CONFIG for the OS user that will run the RDP tools. This is preferably the same user
that owns the PostgreSQL server process.

e. Verify that the OS user can connect to Spectrum Protect server. This will also verify correct file access to local SP files.

    
    dsmc q session -se=XXX (where ‘XXX’ is your logical SErvername)
    

**2. Install Repostor Data Protector client**

a. Verify that IBM Spectrum Protect clients for API and BA are already installed.
Sample listing of IBM Spectrum Protect clients:

    
    rpm -aq | grep TIV
    TIVsm-API64-8.1.8-0.x86_64
    TIVsm-BA-8.1.8-0.x86_64
    

b. Install RDP (verify that you have latest version on www.repostor.com)

    
    rpm -ivh rdp4Postgres-4.4.4.0-31.x86_64
    
Note: On Ubuntu, you need to prepare package with ‘alien’ tool:

    sudo apt-get install alien
    sudo alien rdp4Postgres-4.4.4.0-31.x86_64.rpm
    sudo dpkg -I rdp4Postgres-4.4.4.0-31.deb


c. Install license file.

The license.dat file should be placed in the Repostor ‘/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/etc’ directory. If no
license is available yet a trial license will be automatically generated the first time a backup is run. This
trial license needs to be cleared with a special “UNLOCK” key before changing to a contract license.

d. Add Repostor ‘bin’ directory to the PATH

All users that will run RDP commands will need to have the PATH set to include the Repostor ‘bin’ directory
(/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/bin).

**3. Verify connection to PostgreSQL ‘psql’**

**The user used with the “-u” option to the RDP commands needs to be able to connect to PostgreSQL and be
allowed to backup/restore databases.**

Sample verifying connection for user ‘enterprisedb’:

    psql -U enterprisedb -l

**4. Configure PostgreSQL ‘archive_command’ to use logwriter**

**If your PostgreSQL environment has WAL activated and you plan to backup PostgreSQL on the “instance”
level (“-f” option with RDP), then you need to configure the PostgreSQL ‘archive_command’ to run the
RDP logwriter.script.**

Sample of a specification of the ‘archive_command’ in the postgresql.conf file:

    archive_command =
    ‘/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/bin/logwriter.script -v -S instName
    -s “%p” -d %f’

!!! Note
    The instance name you specify with the ”-S” option, needs to be the same you use with the RDP ’postgresbackup’
    command. The logwriter.script is a script that calls the logwriter binary. It is a script to allow for local configuration if you want
    to set a specific environment before running the logwriter.

**5. Setup a backup script**

**If you run postgresbackup from a script that initiated from Spectrum Protect scheduler, the LOGNAME
should be set.**

Simple backup script sample. Please note that the PATHs and filenames are unique to each installation:

    #!/bin/bash
    #

    ### Set PATH & DSMI_CONFIG
    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/bin
    export DSMI_CONFIG=/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.postgres.opt

    ### Set LOGNAME
    export LOGNAME=enterprisedb

    ### Run postgresbackup command, send output to logfile under /tmp
    postgresbackup -u enterprisedb -f -z -v >/tmp/postgresbackup.log 2>&1

## 3.3 Integration Views

The current RDP version is a command-line client. There are three commands that the user runs
(postgresbackup, postgresquery & postgresrestore) and then there are the logwriter & logreader tools that are
automatically called by PostgreSQL during execution of ‘archive_command ‘and ‘restore_command’.

(For details and more samples of daily operation tasks, please see RDP user guide chapter 5.)
