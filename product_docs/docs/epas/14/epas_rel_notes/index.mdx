## EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14 Features

The major highlights of this release are :

-   Store create and last DDL time for the objects.
    
    This feature allows a user to track an object when it is created and when it was last modified. Users can now view the created and last ddl time through respective redwood compatible views.
-  Implementation of `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE`.

   With `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause you can provide the subpartition descriptor, so that there is no need to specify for each partition. Specify the `TEMPLATE` once and it gets applied to every partition automatically.
-  Access the partition by `PARTITION (<partname>)` or subpartition by `SUBPARTITION (<subpartname>)` clause.

   Advanced Server allows access to the particular partition using the `PARTITION(<partname>)` clause and sub-partition using the `SUBPARTITION(<subpartname>)` clause.  This feature implements the same in Advanced Server, which allows the use of such clauses for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` queries.
-  In this release Advanced Server has enhanced the `CONNECT_BY` feature.  With this, Advanced Server now supports:
   -  Allow the use of multiple `PRIOR` expressions.
   -  Use `AND/OR` with multiple conditions to allow any combination of Unary, Binary, or Prior expressions.
   -  Use of Unary expressions.
   -  Make `PRIOR` optional with `CONNECT BY` query.
   -  Enhance the function to detect the cycle, so that it can work with multiple `PRIOR` expressions.
   -  Support for `CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE` and `NOCYCLE`.
   -  Support `PRIOR` in the target list.
-  Add support for object level auditing.
  
   This feature allows selective auditing of objects for specific DML statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` in the `edb_audit_statement` GUC with a group, and later a group can be specified for a relation. This also allows users to specify either include `(@)` or exclude `(-)` particular statement type for a relation. Currently this feature supports `{SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT}@groupname`, statement type for a group.
-  Audit Log Archiver.

   A new feature `edb_audit_archiver` is added, which helps DBA in controlling the space consumed by the audit log directory & management of the audit log files. This new feature helps in compressing the old audit log files by specifying the compression command of your choice, executing an user's specified command before removing an audit log file & removing the old audit log files.
 
-  Add support for `USERENV()`.

   This function provides user environment and session related details.
 
-  Add Redwood compatible bitwise `AND` and `OR` functions and aggregates.
 
   Unlike existing bitwise functions and aggregates, these also support bitwise operation on a numeric data type for the Redwood compatibility. In addition to that, added bitwise '&' and '|' operators for the numeric data type.
-  Support for alias on table name in `INSERT` statement.

   Advanced Server supports `ALIAS` for accessing a partition or subpartition with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements so that further it can be used to qualify the table columns. For Example: `INSERT INTO table_name t (t.col1) VALUES (10);`
 
-  Provide an option to audit the `SET` commands.

   This feature provides an option in `edb_audit_statement` to log the `SET` commands. To enable this user needs to modify the `log_statement` GUC.
 
-  Enhance `DBMS_SQ`L to be more compatible with Oracle.

   Enhanced `DBMS_SQL` package functions to accept `NUMBER` instead of `INTEGER` so that both `INTEGER` to `NUMBER` functions can accept both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER` type values. Since these functions are now compatible with both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER`, we need to restrict the input range within the `INTEGER`'s limit.
-  Create `ROWID` columns with `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`.

   When the remote table has a rowid system column then the respective foreign table, which gets created as part of the `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` used to skip the `rowid` column for the foreign table, but it should create it. This feature supports the same.
 
-  Advanced Server now uses a global sequence for the `ROWID`s.

   Now `ROWID` will be unique across the database and this will allow to use the `ROWID` on the partitioned table. 
 
-  Enhance `NVL2` to use `ANYCOMPATIBLE` pseudo-type.

   This feature allows `NVL2` function to support considerably more argument type combinations than before. For example, the `NVL2` version can match a call with one `INTEGER` and rest `BIGINT` arguments, the `INTEGER` automatically promoted to `BIGINT`. With the previous `ANYELEMENT` version, the user would have had to cast the `INTEGER` explicitly.

-  Improved Oracle compatibility syntax which allows users to migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server without requiring to apply these syntax changes on manual migration efforts.

   `ENABLE` keyword is supported so that the query would be accepted and have the same result as in Oracle (a default index being created for the constraint).
 
   When a user runs a query with the `USING INDEX ENABLE` construct, the query would be accepted and have the same result as in Oracle.
 
   When a user tries to create a sequence with a too high upper boundary, Advanced Server would apply the upper boundary and log a warning message.
 
   When a user creates a sequence with specifying the `NOORDER` keyword, the keyword is considered a `NOOP` keyword and a warning message is logged which states that specifying the `NOORDER` keyword has no beneficial effect in EDB Postgres Advanced and is ignored. 
 
   `NOCYCLE` keyword is now accepted and implemented as the (already existing) `NOCYCLE` keyword.
-   With `\h` command, the user gets to see the syntax on a psql prompt. Extended `\h` support to work with EDB Postgres Advanced Server objects.
 
-   Added tab-completion support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server syntaxes.
